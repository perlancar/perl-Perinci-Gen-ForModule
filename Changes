Revision history for Perinci-Gen-ForModule

0.08    2015-09-03 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- [dist] Move spec prereqs from RuntimeRequires to
	  DevelopRecommends to reduce deps but still allow indicating spec
	  requirement.

	- Switch from Log::Any to Log::Any::IfLOG.


0.07    2015-08-18 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Switch from Log::Any to Log::Any::IfLOG.


0.06    2015-01-11 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Now skip the whole package if %SPEC already has something.


0.05    2015-01-11 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

        - Avoid perl undef warning, as well as switch from using
          Scalar::Util::reftype() to ref() as I don't have a need to use
          reftype().


0.04    2014-12-05 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- Use the new renamed module SHARYANTO::Package::Util ->
	  Package::MoreUtil.

	- Remove 'promotional' 'This module uses {Log::Any,Rinci,Moo}
	  module' messages, because Log::Any and Moo are now very popular
	  already, and this message is redundant anyway (one can see deps
	  in MetaCPAN etc).
